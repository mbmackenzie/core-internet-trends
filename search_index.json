In 2018, more than 77% of Americans over the age of 18 used the internet at least once per day, and in 2019 that number rose to over 82%. The United States has a $290 Billion digital infrastructure in place, capable of delivering speeds of many gigbits per second.1 When there is this much bandwidth to go arround, two major questions come to mind: Who has internet access? And what are they doing with it? These simple questions are perhaps answered with Occum’s razor-esque answers: Everyone has internet access. Everyone is on Facebook. While the above is an exageration, despite the small scope of this analysis by only having access to 2018 and 2019 data, we will find our Facebook claim to be remarkably close to the truth (at least with this survey). 0.1 Background On October 29, 1969 at Stanford University, the letters “L” and “O” flashed on a monitor, followed by an assumed sigh of frustration, as the first “internet” based transmission crashed the ARPA network. The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPAnet) was a United States Department of Defense project with the goal of linking computers together. The letter “L” and “O” were the first two letters of the word “LOGIN”, and the message that failed at Stanford was sent from UCLA, which is an admirable 650 miles away.2 For the next 20 years, the “interent” continued to advance, with additions like TCP/IP, DNS, .com, and a steadily growing host base of over 100,000 by 1989. In 1990, ARPAnet is no more, however at the same time Tim Berners-Lee develops the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the foundation of modern web browsing. In 1991, the world wide web is introduced to the public by Cern. The modern internet is born. Many of the websites we cherish today were formed many years ago. Google search was created in 1998, Facebook in 2004, YouTube in 2005, Twitter in 2006. By 2010, Facebook had an active userbase of 400 million.3 Today, that number is at 2.45 billion users, that means roughly 1 in every 3 people on earth has a Facebook account. Is Facebook the reason we use the internet so much? Or is it the internet that draws us to the dominant social media platform, which right now happens to be Facebook? 0.2 The Analysis The primary analysis will be diveded in three parts: How much do people use the internet and what for? Are there any relationships between where people live, their ethnic background, the economic trends of the region, and other demographic characteristics and how they use the internet? How do Americans view the internet as a tool for society both overall and personally?

The surevey consists of questions designed to probe a person’s use of the internet, social media, and other electronic and non electronic things like books, tv, and phones. The survey also asks a number of questions about a person’s demographics including their age, race, income, etc. This survey seems to be conducted every year, but we were only able to obtain data for 2018 and 2019. This is where the first major problem stems from, different questions were asked in both of these years. The 2018 survey contains a series of questions about the respondent’s view on the impact of the internet on society, while 2019 does not. And in 2019, there was a series of questions asked about a persons internet service they subscibe to, while 2018 did not. Other than thsese questions, every other questions was asked. For a complete list of features in this dataset and the questions and possible answers associated with it, please see Appendix A. 1.2 Pew Reseach Center The Pew Research Center{target=&quot;_blank} is a “nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.” Starting in 1990,the then Times Mirror Center for the People &amp; the Press began conducting polls on politics and other major policy of the times. In 1996, the Pew Research Center was concieved with funds from the Pew Charitable Trusts, and fully blossomed with its potential in 2004. For the next decade, the Center would combine the work of the Census Bureau and their own surveys, before moving on to becomming a pioneer in the “frontier of social science research.”4 1.3 Methodology The 2018 Interent Core Trends Survey was conducted between Janurary 3 and 10, 2018. During this window, a sample of 2,002 respondents were called via cellphone (1,502) and landline (500) phone calls. The interviews were conducted in English and Spanish as needed. The target universe of this survey is “non-institutionalized persons age 18 and over” living in the United States. The cell phone numbers were drawn from the random digit dial (RDD) of a a set of phone numbers. The questionare was developed by the Pew Research Center in consultation with Abt Associates. The questionnaire was pretested on random repondents by experienced interview givers, and this led to some changes being made on the final questionnaire. As for calling procedures, numbers were called back up to 7 times for english speakers, and 10 times for spanish speakers. In cases where there was only slight push to refuse the survey from the repondents, the interviewrs were allowed to try and sway them to take the surevey. For landline interviews, the interviewer asked to speak with the youngest male or female at home, and cellular interviews were conducted with whoever picked up. For cellular interviews, interviewers offered respondents a post-paid cash incentive of $5 for their participation. 1.4 Dataset Profile The final, clean version of the Internet Core Trends data that we will be using consists of 3504 observations in 77 variables. Below is a more thorough breakdown by the raw data: Property 2018 2019 rows 2002 1502 columns 70 74 all_missing_columns 0 0 total_missing_values 28026 31429 complete_rows 0 0 total_observations 140140 111148 The majority of coulumns are discrete in nature, as the possible answers are limited to specific responses allowed by the interviewer. Age is open to any value less than or equal to 97. This makes analysis particularly interesting since there only categorical values. 1.5 Downloading the Data The data for each year was downloaded separately from Pew Reasearch’s website (links at top of page) as zip files. After extraction, both a CSV and SAS file containing the raw data were included. Also included were the questions asked, summary data files, and in 2018 the methodology document. The SAS file and CSV file only differed in the fact the SAS file used labeled data frames. https://www.pewresearch.org/about/our-history/↩ "],
["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 2 Data Transformation 2.1 Creating the Data Dictionary 2.2 Renaming the Variables 2.3 Keeing the Data Wide 2.4 Preprocessing Age", " Chapter 2 Data Transformation 2.1 Creating the Data Dictionary To begin the transformation process, we found it most usefull to create a data dictionary since there were many variables each with many different possible values. To do this, we went through each survey document as well as the data to keep track of variable names, question, and possible values. After this, we recorded each in a CSV file the we could then use in later scripts. The first script (format_data_dictionary.R) was used to parse the CSV file and format the tables seen in Appendix A. The next script (replace_levels.R) contains functions that allow us to replace the numerical values of a column with the textual representation with ease. Throughout the analysis process, we found it easiser to filter based on the numerical values, and then transform the levels. 2.2 Renaming the Variables Many of the names used in the raw data were quite cryptic. We used the tidying process to rename variables to be grouped by what they were discussing, and be easily selectable if we wanted to look at a group of varibles. We settled on 9 groups: Identifiers, Demographics, Devices, Internet, Social Media, Depenence, Society, Books, and Other. These groups are reflected in the Data Dictionary in Appendix A. The variables were manually changed in our preprocessing script, tidy_data.R. The second reason for renaming the varibles was to ensure that we could properly overlap the data from 2018 and 2019. As some variable did or didn’t exist from year to year, or the varible names might change, we dealt with this before it became a problem. 2.3 Keeing the Data Wide We decided to keep the data in a “wide” format. There were so many features that it was actually easier to just filter by column as we needed it, and then perform any gathering that we may need to do. 2.4 Preprocessing Age Much of the time, the actual age of repondents was to granular to work with. We tried binning the age in different ways, but eventually settled on the age groups 18 to 34, 35 to 64, and 65 over 65 (inclusive). We felt this was enough to show anything interesting relating to differences in age. It also captures much of the generational differeneces we see today, mainly millenials, generation X, and baby boomers. "],

The selected variables are year, state, age, education, employment, house. income, race, internet.freq, sm.use, society.overall and depend.sm. ## NOTE: The following pairs of variables appear to have the same missingness pattern. ## Please verify whether they are in fact logically distinct variables. ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] &quot;sm.use&quot; &quot;society.overall&quot; Missing Patterns nothing depend.sm internet.freq internet.freq, depend.sm sm.use, depend.sm, society.overall internet.freq, sm.use, depend.sm, society.overall Taking all together, we have identified that a large number of missing values are in the variable of social media use, overall society, and dependency on social media. Some values are also missing in the frequency of internet use. We then try to analyze the missing value by dividing it into groups by year. 3.1 Missing Value Patterns We begin by looking at the missing data by year. First 2018. In 2018, all the missing values are for the variables “dependent on social media” and “internet frequency” More than 5% of the data is missing for both the variables. Nearly 75% of the data is missing for nothing. Now we look at 2019. ## NULL In 2019, we observe only 2 missing patterns. All the 3 variables “social media use”, “society overall” and “depend on social media” are missing for all data. Perhaps, these are the questions were not asked in the 2019 survey. However, 5% of data for internet frequency is missing along with other variables. Apart from missing data, we have also analyzed the data where responded refused to answer or chose an answer as “Don’t know” 3.2 “Don’t Know” Response Patterns 2018 2019 In 2018, we see that a number of people answered: “Don’t Know” for the response of house.income, race, education, social.overall and internet.freq. There is also a few people answered “Don’t Know” for employment. But in 2019, relatively fewer people answered “Don’t Know” 3.3 “Refused” Response Patterns 2018 2019 In 2018, a lot of people refused to answer on house income, race, education, and employment. We also see the same pattern of response in 2019. "],

Americans reap the benefits of impressive internet speeds and and consistent coverage that enables them to utilize the internet in many facets. In 2019, 81% of Americans subscribed to home internet services and of those, 92% of had access to high speed internet. Figure 4.1: On the left: the break down of internet speeds in the entire United States. This percentage is out of only people who answered they subscribed to internet services at home. On the right: the percentage of adults in the US that subscribe to internet services at home. 4.1.2 Interent as a Whole Of these people that subscribe to interent services, the next step is to investigate how much people use it. There is an unwaivering similarity between internet happits in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, more than 77% of Americans over the age of 18 used the internet at least once per day, and in 2019 that number rose to over 82%. The vast majority of respondents admit to using the internet “several times a day” in both years, and the majority of the remaining people use it constantly. This means that for the most part, if someone subscribes to the internet, they are using it quite a bit. Unfortunately there is no further questioning about the where the time people put into the internet goes other than social media, so this information does not speak about used for work or leisure. Regardless, it is telling about our modern society that so many people are open to sharing this habbit. Figure 4.2: The breakdown of internet usage, faceted by year, for all adults in the US. 4.1.3 Social Media Usage Figure 4.3: The breakdown of how adults in the US use social media by how much they use the internet. The percentages are taken within each internet usage group, across both 2018 and 2019. Figure 4.4: Breakdown of multiple social media usages, across both 2018 and 2019 by age. This graph was generated with the HH package. 4.2 Demographics: Age, Income, and the Internet Figure 4.5: AC: Almost constantly; SD: Several times a day; LO: Less often. This graph was generated by the vcd pacakge, and uses data from both 2018 and 2019. Figure 4.6: Using multiple categorical values, the distribution of internet frequency responses were caluclated for each feature:value pair. 4.3 Sociey’s Opinion: Internet Impact on Society So far, it seems that regardless of a person’s age, financial status, houshold, political nature, really background characteristics, Americans, for the most part, use the internet the same amount. So, since it is established that the internet is popular, why is this so? One of the most interesting series of questions asked by the Core Trends survey is about the societal impact of the internt: has the internet been a bad or good thing for both society and why? Unfortunately, this question series was only asked in 2018, but the single year offers some interesting insights into American’s opinions of the internet. "],

["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion In 2002, a study published by Norman Nie and Lutz Erbring from Stanford describes the internet as a “giant public library with a decidedly commercial tilt.” The study found that only 38% of Americans over 18 accessed the internet at home, and a max 55% of adults have access to the internet at all. The paper proceeds to claim that the more people use the internet, the less time they spend with friends and families.5 In 2019, we see a dramatic rise in the number of people that have access to internet at home to over 80%. Most people spend their time on the interent on YouTube and Facebook, two sites that are very much about connecting people from all over the globe. The data in this survey do not point to a trend of losing pysical touch with other humans, but it does point to the desire to gain a digital touch. We saw that social media is more easy to give up than the internet, however we also saw that even people who claim they do not use the internet very frequenyly primarily spend their time on social media sites. There is a discrepency in this. How can people be primarity using social media sites but at the same time be so willing to give it up? This seemingly paradoxical idea suggests that people know something new will always come around. They may be willing to give up the current sites, but if the question had been phrased in such a way that social media would be lost to them forever, we believe the reponses would have been very much shifted towards the “impossible” answer.
