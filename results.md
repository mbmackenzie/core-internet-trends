### Interent as a Whole

Of these people that subscribe to interent services, the next step is to investigate how much people use it. There is an unwaivering similarity between internet happits in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, more than 77% of Americans over the age of 18 used the internet at least once per day, and in 2019 that number rose to over 82%. The vast majority of respondents admit to using the internet "several times a day" in both years, and the majority of the remaining people use it constantly. This means that for the most part, if someone subscribes to the internet, they are using it quite a bit. Unfortunately there is no further questioning about the where the time people put into the internet goes other than social media, so this information does not speak about used for work or leisure. Regardless, it is telling about our modern society that so many people are open to sharing this habbit.
